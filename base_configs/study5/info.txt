Reconstruction Frame

1) find approximation for LIV_F (dy) and LIV_N (dy)

d = 1.2 dy = [0, 5, 10] t_sym 50
d = 1.6 dy = [0, 5, 10] t_sym 75
d = 2.4 dy = [0, 5, 10] t_sym 100

find f peak mean and n peak mean

high symbol duration avoids too strong ISI effects

mean over 3 sim runs

=> result: analytical approximation for prediction to pic frame
