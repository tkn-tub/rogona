Impact of symbol duration:

Study 1 also painted the picture of higher distances being quite hard to distinguish because of the great time domain spread.
Study 2 shall therefore investigate whether 

a) an increased pause duration (increases bit duration; %sp reduced)
b) an increased spray duration (does not increase bit duration; CAUTION: pause must be at least 30 ms because of the Tx architecture)
c) combination of both

helps this.
